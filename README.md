# dvla

Simple command line to provide a car registration number (without spaces) and it will get details from the
DVLA API and also open the UK gov MOT website for that vehicle.

e.g. dvla OP23ENS

You will need to modify this script and provide your own API key which you have to obtain youself from the DVLA.
